BlueSpice comes with the ExtJS JavaScript Framework by Sencha Inc.
We use version 4.2.1.883, which is the lastest build from the V4 line released
under the GPL licence.

==Using it in extensions==
When developing an extension create a "base namespace" folder in your
extensions "resources/" or "modules/" directory. The "base namespace" should be
a unique identifier for your extension. E.g. "BS.MyExtension". Within this
directory you can place your class definitions ('Ext.define' calls). If you
seperate your code into subnamespaces, every portion of the namespace should be
a subfolder. E.g for class 'BS.MyExtension.dialog.EditRow' the structure would
be:

 <mediawiki>/extensions/MyExtension/resources/
     BS.MyExtension/
         dialog/
             EditRow.js

By using this convention ExtJS will load the class files on demand. There is no
need to add the files from the "base namespace" folder to a dedicated RL module.

You can also modify the ExtJS autoloader by calling 'setPath' on 'Ext.Loader':

Ext.Loader.setPath( 'BS.NotMyExtension.something', mw.config.get('wgScriptPath')
 + '/extensions/MyExtension/resources/BS.NotMyExtension.something'
);

Don't forget to run this code only when 'ext.bluespice.extjs' is loaded
('mw.loader.using')!

==API documentation==
For a complete documentation of the ExtJS framework see
http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1

==Themes==
By default the "bluespice" theme is used. It it a custom build based on ExtJS's
'neptune' theme, created with SenchaCmd.

Please refer to the official ExtJS documentation to learn how to create your
own themes: http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/guide/theming

If you want to use a different theme (e.g. on a custom BlueSpice/MediaWiki skin)
you can do so by redefining the 'ext.bluespice.extjs.theme' module in your
skin's setup file or in the LocalSettings.php:

 $wgResourceModules['ext.bluespice.extjs.theme'] = array(
     //...
 );
