This is a brief overview of the new design of BlueSpice 2.0.

==General==
With BlueSpice 2 we tried to be more MediaWiki compliant. Therefore most of the
folders you know from MediaWiki appear in the BlueSpice* extensions. We now 
make use of ResourceLoader and populate the client side with a lot of useful 
information.

One core component is the ExtJS Rich Internet Applications JavaScript Framework
by Sencha.

In resouces/bluespice.extjs/BS you can find additional reusable components.

==TODO==
* Refactor the "outputhandler/views" files.
** Or better: replace usage of these with config arrays and "Html" class
* Redesign "BsConfig" mechanism
** Maybe rely on MediaWiki "SiteConfig"
